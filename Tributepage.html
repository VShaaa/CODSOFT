                <p style="color:maroon"><b>From torchbearer to transformer</b>, Chairman Emeritus <b>Ratan Tata</b> has played shepherd and sentinel while guiding the Tata group into a new age, and he has done it in his own distinctive style.</p>
                <h2 style="background-color: maroon;">PERSONAL HISTORY</h2>
                <p style="color:maroon">On <b>December 28, 1937</b>, Ratan Tata was born to Naval and Sooni Tata in <b>Bombay</b>. Ratanji Tata, Jamsetji Tata's younger son, adopted Naval Tata as his son. When Ratan was ten years old, his parents divorced. His grandmother, Navajbai Tata, reared him and his half-brother, Noel Tata.He went to <b>Campion School</b> in Bombay till 8th grade, then moved to <b>Cathedral and John Connon Schools</b> in Bombay and <b>Bishop Cotton School</b> in Shimla for further academic activities.

                <h2 style="background-color: maroon;">CAREER</h2>
                <p style="color:maroon">He began his career as a mining worker at his firm in <b>1962</b>, which is somewhat stunning. He shoveled stones and worked on the furnaces along with the other laborers. It was physically difficult work, but it taught him more about his parent's business and helped him value it. Ratan took over as <b>chairman of Tata Sons</b> after J.R.D. Tata stepped down in <b>1991</b>.

                    Due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata, he had to encounter significant opposition from the CEOs of several organizations, who proceeded to become highly strong. Although, he overcame all those resistance. Research, or innovation, was given a high emphasis under his administration, and the younger generation was handed the majority of the tasks.
                    
                    <b>Tata Group</b> prospered the greatest during his supervision of <b>21 years</b>, with revenues rising by <b>40%</b> and profits increasing by <b>50%</b>. His daring investments in major multinational corporations like <b>Jaguar, Tetley & Land Rover</b>, and <b>Corus Steel</b>, among others, significantly influenced the Indian industrial sector and the global industrial sector</p>

He is creating many such examples, which can give us a lesson to make significant changes
